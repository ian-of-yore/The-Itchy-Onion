    <h2><q><i>I dream of a world where chickens can cross the road without having their motives questioned!</q></i></h2>

    <h3>Movie Geek! Music Lover! Electrical Engineer! Programming Fnatic! Part-time Street Photographer!</h3>

    <p>I have completed my <strong> Bachelor</strong> from Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology <strong>(AUST)</strong> in August 2021, from Electrical & Electronic Engineering <strong>(EEE)</strong> discipline. During my Undergrad studies, I fell in love with Data Science. In continuation of that passion, I opted to do my final year <strong> Thesis in Machine Learning.</strong> I graduated with a determination to serve in the nation's <strong>Automation & IT</strong>  industry. Nevertheless, witnessing the fragile infrastructure of job placements and primitive mindset of the industry to fresh graduates, I decided to halt and take some time to explore my options that would compliment my talents and future aspirations. Following a couple of months, I decided to pursue a career in <strong> Web Development</strong>. So, here I am, enrolled in this course by <strong> Jhankar Mahabub</strong> and trying my best to keep up to the expectations</p>
