            <h3>Movie Geek! Music Lover! Electrical Engineer! Programming Fnatic! Part-time Street Photographer!</h3>
            <p>I have completed my <strong> Bachelor</strong> from Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology
                <strong>(AUST)</strong> in August 2021, from Electrical & Electronic Engineering <strong>(EEE)</strong>
                discipline. During my Undergrad studies, I fell in love with Data Science. In continuation of that
                passion,
                I opted to do my final year <strong> Thesis in Machine Learning.</strong> I graduated with a
                determination
                to serve in the nation's <strong>Automation & IT</strong> industry. Nevertheless, witnessing the fragile
                infrastructure of job placements and primitive mindset of the industry to fresh graduates, I decided to
                halt
                and take some time to explore my options that would compliment my talents and future aspirations.
                Following
                a couple of months, I decided to pursue a career in <strong> Web Development</strong>. So, here I am,
                enrolled in this course by <strong> Jhankar Mahabub</strong> and trying my best to keep up to the
                expectations

                Wandering around the streets of Europe with a Fujifilm Mirrorless camera hanging around the neck,
                without
                a single care in the world. A digital Nomad. Not settling down. No certain home to return to. The world
                is
                my oyster. Software Engineering job paying my bills. Have the audacity to be spontaneous. Back-packing
                through the world.
                A cat, maybe even a human parter. One Day! Maybe soon. Auf Wiedersehen!

                <p>
                    In the pursuit of a career in the Programming industry, I went through various stages. After wasting
                    time on lots on different tutorials, numerous suggestions, trying to grasp a whole lot of skills,
                    countless sleepless nights, I finally enrolled in the course titled, "Complete Web Development with
                    Jhankar Mahabub". Working on module 04 right now. Completed basic HTML, CSS, Git and finally working
                    on
                    a portfolio werbsite. Things working out pretty well so far. Let's see!

                <p>
                    After completing my Higher Secondary Studies in 2015 from Notre Dame College <strong>(NDC)</strong>,
                    I
                    failed massively in the admission test. I couldn't manage to get into any University of my priority
                    list. Luckly, I had my family's support and tried for Private Universities. Clearing the admission
                    with
                    flying colors, I started my journey at Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology. Though I had
                    the
                    option
                    to choose CSE, I choose EEE, just because at that time, I hated coding and thought this was not a
                    degree
                    worth spending money on. Haa! the Irony. Though I didn't enjoy my studies, I had put on a robot
                    face,
                    and tried my best to secure a good CGPA in order to opt for Higher studies after graduation. Even
                    after
                    lots of disappointments and regrets, I am satisfied that I got out with a very good result from one
                    of
                    the countries Esteemed university for Engineering Discipline.
